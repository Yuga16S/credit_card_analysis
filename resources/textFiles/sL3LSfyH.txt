Are you an international student? You can apply for a BMO credit card by visiting a branch.Have reached the age of majority in the province in which you live (18 years in AB, MB, ON, PE, QC and SK. 19 years in all other provinces).Earn annual income from employment, scholarship/grant, student loan or family allowance.What are the benefits of a student credit card?Along with convenience, there are a number of reasons why applying for a student credit card makes financial sense:A student card is generally easier to qualify for than other credit cards.You’ll start building a credit history. By using your card and paying if off every month, you’ll show you’re responsible with credit, making it easier to qualify for a loan, line of credit or mortgage in the future.You’ll earn cash back every time you spend.How will I know which grocery purchases qualify for 3% cash back?When you make a purchase at a grocery store or supermarket that sells a complete line of food products (think vegetables, ice cream and everything in between), you can earn 3% cash back up to a limit of $500 spent for a given statement period. 2CConvenience stores, bakeries, butchers and other speciality shops are excluded from this offer (those purchases will earn the base rate of 0.5% cash back).Not sure if your store qualifies? Please call the number on the back of your card to speak with a representative who can help answer your questions.How will I know which payments qualify for 1% cash back on recurring bill payments?Recurring (or ongoing) bill payments are made on a regular basis – your monthly Internet bill, for example. The merchant (in this example, your Internet service provider) automatically bills your card each month. This sort of automatic bill payment made with your BMO CashBack® Mastercard®* may be eligible for 1% cash back (0.5% base rate, plus 0.5% bonus up to $500 spent for each statement period).2DNot all merchants offer recurring payments, and not every recurring bill payment will earn the bonus cash back, so check with your providers to find out how they are processing your bill payment.Where can I find my cash back balance?It’s easy! There are three simple ways to see how much you’ve earned:Log in to the www.bmocashback.comorCheck your cash back balance on your monthly BMO credit card statement.orCheck your cash back balance when you log in to BMO Online Banking or the BMO Mobile Banking app.To help you keep tabs on your cash back activity, your Online Statement shows you how much you’ve earned, up to the billing date. Any cash back earned after the billing date will be included in your next month’s statement.How can I redeem my cash back?You can redeem your cash back for as little as $1 by visiting www.bmocashback.com. You can also setup recurring redemptions for as little as $25. You have the option to redeem your cash back right into your BMO chequing or savings account, or as a statement credit on your BMO CashBack Mastercard.To get direct deposits, you’ll need a BMO chequing, savings or InvestorLine account.Help!
